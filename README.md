# ImageEditor
An image manipulation software that can read, generate, and edit commonly supported image formats

## Purpose
The objective of this program is to act as an image manipulation software. It has the ability to read commonly supported image formats (such as .png and .jpg) and edit these images (such as blur). It can also generate an image based on a pattern (such as a checkerboard). The software also supports the use of layers, allowing for multiple images to be layered on-top of each other and the ability to hide and show specific layers. The software also supports the ability to save and load multiple images from its current state to be restored later.
